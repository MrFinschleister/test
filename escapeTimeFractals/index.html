        <p id="info-p-1">This site is a visualisation of escape time fractals. Put simply, these are just formulas using complex numbers that test how long a value will take to reach infinity. Most of these formulas derive one complex number from its X/Y position, and another from user inputs. The inputs on the top-left define four primary things: </p>
        <ol id="info-ol"><li>Default X/Y - The independant variable of the formulas used for the fractals. If the fractal starts out looking really boring, try changing this.</li><li>P: This is used as a constant value in a few of the formulas. Only a few of them use it, but it has a pretty big effect on them.</li><li>Number Max: This is used to specify when a value will be considered "approaching infinity". Increasing it doesn't really do anything, but decreasing it can make some cool shapes.</li><li>Fractal Type &#40;the dropdown&#41;: This determines what formula will be used. Some of them are a little more complex than others, so they may slow down the simulation.</li></ol></li>
